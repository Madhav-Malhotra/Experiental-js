# Experiential.js

When someone reads my writing, I can't just improve the CONTENT to make it better. I also have to improve the CONTEXT of _how_ they read the writing. Ex: Are they scrolling through in a rush while checking other notifications? Or are they greeted by a welcome screen and some calming music?

This is why I created this site. **It lets you create a HTML article with customised welcome screens, music, colours, and font**. All without any coding :-)

If you'd like to try it out, go [here](https://experiential-ly.web.app) :-)
